# Project notes

The book uses class components, while being obsolete, I will use them because : 
1. I am working on some legacy projects that need the knowledge of class components
2. I came to learn redux not to confuse myself how to implement certain functionalities using functional components
3. The good thing about this book is that it uses **plain redux** not `redux toolkit`, so we have the opportunity to get a low level understanding of redux
